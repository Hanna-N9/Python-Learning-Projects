# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my solutions and projects completed during the "Learn Python 3" course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). The course has been instrumental in my journey to mastering Python, and I'm sharing these solutions and projects to document my progress and to potentially help others who might be learning Python as well.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- `lessons`: Contains solutions and exercises from the individual lessons of the course.
- `projects`: Contains projects that I've built as part of the course, demonstrating the practical application of Python concepts.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the cloned directory
3. Open the solutions and projects in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
