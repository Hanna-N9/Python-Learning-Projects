# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my solutions and projects completed during the "Learn Python 3" course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). The course has been instrumental in my journey to maunderstandingstering Python, and I'm sharing these solutions and projects to document my progress.

## Blog Post

I've also written a blog post titled ["Similarities and Differences between Python and JavaScript"](https://medium.com/@hnegash.n/similarities-and-differences-between-python-and-javascript-4051bd991991) on Medium. This post delves into the syntax of both languages, showcasing my understanding of Python and JavaScript, especially in terms of syntax differences. This post serves as a supplementary resource, showcasing my understanding of Python and JavaScript, especially in terms of syntax differences.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- `lessons`: This folder contains my solutions to the individual lessons of the course. Each lesson's folder includes my Python scripts, which might be phrased differently from the lesson's original solution but aim to demonstrate the same concepts.
- `projects`: This folder contains my projects completed as part of the course.
