# How to assign variables with user input?
  # While we output a variable’s value using print(), we assign information to a variable using input(). 
  # The input() function requires a prompt message, which it will print out for the user before they enter the new information.

# 1. The program would print "What is your favorite color? " for the user.
# 2. The user would enter an answer (e.g., "My favorite color is green!") and press enter.
# 3. The variable favorite_color would be assigned a value of the user’s answer.
favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
