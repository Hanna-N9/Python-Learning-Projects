# Python refers to the mistakes within the program as errors and will point to the location where an error occurred with a ^ character. 
# When programs throw errors that we didnâ€™t expect to encounter, we call those errors bugs. 
# Programmers call the process of updating the program so that it no longer produces bugs debugging.
# The interpreter will tell us where (the file name and line number) it got into trouble and its best guess as to what is wrong.

# Common errors:
  # SyntaxError: Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language.
  # NameError: Errors reported when the interpreter detects a variable that is unknown.
  # TypeError: Errors thrown when an operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
