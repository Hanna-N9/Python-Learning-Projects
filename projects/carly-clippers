# This program uses loops to go through the lists based on trends in the hair salon's operation over the last couple of weeks.

# hairstyles: the names of the cuts offered at Carlyâ€™s Clippers.
# prices: the price of each hairstyle in the hairstyles list.
# last_week: the number of purchases for each hairstyle type in the last week.

# Prices and Cuts:

# Average price of a haircut.
# Create a variable total_price, and set it to 0
# Loop through the prices list and add each price to the variable total_price
# Create a variable called average_price that is the total_price divided by the number of prices

# Use a list comprehension to make a list called new_prices

# Revenue:

# How revenue was brought in last week.
# Create a variable called total_revenue and set it to 0.
# Use a for loop to create a variable i that goes from 0 to len(hairstyles)
# Add the product of prices[i] (the price of the haircut at position i) and last_week[i] (the number of people who got the
# haircut at position i) to total_revenue at each step.
# Find the average daily revenue by dividing total_revenue by 7. Call this number average_daily_revenue

# new_prices[i] is less than 30
